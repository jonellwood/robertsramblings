### Unpredictable Nature of Life

As life goes by, it’s usually unpredictable. No matter how much you plan or what you may do to try and steer the course you want, there are way too many variables to know for sure. Each day brings challenges and obstacles that make the clear visioned path seen yesterday not so clear.

### Challenges and Decision-Making

The path is easily known to the one who wishes to travel it, but maintaining the path is the difficult part since choices and decisions may cause a disruption with the planned course of travel. Knowing this will always help because everyone should know nothing comes easy or without struggle.

### Determination and Adaptability

The thing to remember is the amount of effort you are willing to put forth to travel in the direction of the chosen path, even if it’s not on the path. You can still make headway by trying your best to do what you can to not be knocked off the path, just slightly detoured.

### Readiness for Life's Challenges

This is an easy thing to say, especially if you do not currently have any issues and everything is smooth sailing. But keep in mind it can happen in a split second, so you need to be poised to handle whatever life can throw at you and whenever it is thrown at you.

This is an easy thing to say, especially if you do not currently have any issues and everything is smooth sailing. But keep in mind it can happen in a split second, so you need to be poised to handle whatever life can throw at you and whenever it is thrown at you.

### Living vs. Existing

If life never goes as planned, then why should anyone plan anything. As you go through life without direction are you living or existing? When people decide on what they want it should be based on something and as the choices and decisions are made, they stack onto one another which eventually forms their lives.

### Early Path Choices

This whole path choosing happens early in life even if it is not recognized. For instance, as a child some kids may just start following a parent or guardian and their path and eventually fall into the same path once they are old enough to make decisions that keep them on that route. As kids grow, they form relationships with neighbors, schoolmates, and other people outside of their immediate family which can have a direct effect on the path choosing process.

This can be good or bad depending on the type of influence the relationship has over the child. In the end the child will have the ultimate say as he or she grows into an older more mature human to get on a life path.

### Flexibility in Life Paths

The path is never permanent so if someone gets to a crossroad in their journey and needs to make a turn or adjust to get on a different path then those choices and decisions must be made to steer the direction of their choosing at that time. It seems like a simple thing to just stay on a path, but it really is not when you think of all the possible scenarios life can throw at anyone at any given time.

### Post-Treatment Effects

As Robert was lying in bed after his fourth treatment this was the thought going through his head. Robert knows life will never go as planned but is that really a bad thing, how boring life would be if everything was planned and always went as it was supposed to.

Some life altering events can be more drastic than others but as the path is being traveled it is important to adapt and adjust to keep traveling in the desired direction to meet the goals you want and approach the dreams you dream. Robert knows this well and has learned more and more over the past four months. Robert finally drifted off to sleep as he was processing his current path and what needed to be done to keep going and achieve the results he wants.

Robert woke up the next morning with a bit of nausea and some pain in his bones, which is how you usually felt the first few days after receiving his treatment. Tonia got up to go to work and was texting back and forth with her mom who told her Jax was not feeling well. Tonia’s mom said Jax had a fever and a sore throat. Robert told Tonia he would just go back to Bonneau so he would not get sick and Jax could be home to try and get feeling better. Robert packed his bookbag and drove back to Bonneau.

### A day spent thinking

Robert arrived back at his parent’s place and just decided to lie on the couch since he wasn’t feeling well, and he couldn’t do much else. Robert layed and thought all day long before he finally decided to get up and move around some. That evening Robert’s legs were hurting from not doing anything, so Robert went for a walk around the neighborhood. Robert had been thinking all day so of course it did not stop when he started walking. Robert usually uses his walking time for his thinking time to help him process everything and try to run everything through his head to make sure the choices and decisions he might make will keep him on his path. This is more difficult now especially during the first week after chemotherapy because of the chemo and the steroids.

The same thoughts come which makes Robert feel horrible for his overall position in life since he doesn’t have anything, and he really has nowhere to go if it wasn’t for his parents. Being 40 with nowhere to go and living out of bags is the path Robert chose many years ago, but he has a chance to change his path if he can just get it right and make the right decisions to adjust. As was said earlier it is much easier to say than to do. Robert knows what his issues are, but they are engraved in him and will take time to change or adjust. Then Robert thinks he is already 40 and is it too late to try now, it is really never to late he knows but it has to work so he is not going in circles achieving nothing. Robert could call someone to discuss his current issues and dilemma, but he doesn’t have anyone that would care to hear his problems which are understandable.

Robert’s path of having nothing is also a path of having no one. The one person Robert has can never get it right so he never knows what he should do because he wants to be himself but that doesn’t really seem to be the answer at this point in his life. Robert shuffled ideas and what he could do to try and better himself, but no clear answers came about but that was normal since nothing was clear these days. Robert couldn’t find answers, but he knows his true feelings and what he wants if he could just get it right and have his actions be perceived the way he intends. Robert got back to the house and took a shower to just lay back on the couch. Tonia and Jax called to say prayers, which was the brightest part of Robert’s day. Robert really appreciates Tonia, including him with prayers even when he is not there.

### Small victories

That night Robert was up and down throwing up and being sick but he planned for this so he ate mostly popsicles all day so he would not have to throw up anything nasty. The small victories, Robert knew if he was going to be sick, he wanted to be sick on his terms. When Robert got up Wednesday, 10/11/2023, morning he just turned on the TV and did what he did best, lay on the couch.

Robert was definitely overprocessing and thinking way to much about stuff that did not matter or was out of his control, but having so much quiet time was not good for him. Robert wants to contribute to the life he wants to build with Tonia but with his thoughts, tone, saying wrong things, and not being able to help as much as he wants, he is always concerned that Tonia will get tired of the way he is and might be gone at the end of the journey. Robert knows it is out of his control, but all his choices and decisions indirectly effect the way she feels so he has some control over it, but it is hard for him to manage the flood of emotion especially when everything he does and says is perceived so differently than he intends it. When Robert runs thoughts through his head and tries to explain them, they never come out close to how they sounded in his head. Robert knows this is a problem but cannot think of a solution to prevent it.

As Robert sits all alone, he wonders and wonders what he can do to try and better his life going forward or if Tonia would be better off without him. Robert wants to be with Tonia, but he wants to make sure she wants to be with him. Robert’s mind gears continue to turn, and he thinks about his mom saying something after he asked her not to, Robert doesn’t ask for a lot but when something like that is done when it is so unnecessary it makes him not want to tell her anything since there is no trust there. Robert is used to having nobody so he can always just keep everything to himself and swallow what he needs to.

All through Robert’s life he has been told he could live on an island because he can do so well being alone. Robert doesn’t like being alone but as he has traveled his path it has always ended up with him being alone.

### Robert mentality on approaching problems

Robert has always been the best person he could be towards everyone, so he is not sure why he is always alone or if that is just the path that is destined for him. When Robert notices an issue or concern that is of his doing and is brought to his attention, he wants to correct it and make it better to be able to evolve and deepen the relationship. All day Robert as ran thoughts and thoughts through his head unwillingly. Robert misses Tonia and Jaxson, so he has decided to go back to Aiken tomorrow after his VA appointment.

Robert went for a walk to get his legs and bones feeling better and when he was done, as he was walking back to his parent’s house, he noticed his uncle walking into his house across the street. Robert waved and walked up to him to speak. Robert asked his uncle if his aunt was home, his uncle said she was and asked if he wanted to come in. Robert said of course, Robert asked his uncle if they park in the garage because he never stops because he never sees the car. His uncle said they parked in the garage.

Robert walked in and hugged his aunt and asked how she was. She said she was good as she was cooking chicken alfredo for dinner. Robert’s aunt asked him how he was doing, and Robert said he was fine or as good as he can be. Robert asked about his cousin who also suffered a devastating injury the same exact day Robert found out about his cancer. Robert’s aunt said he was doing better but still had a long road to go. His aunt said they just noticed a possible brain bleed in his cousin’s head, Robert asked what took so long for an MRI to check after a trauma.

Robert thought neuro would include an MRI to check for a brain bleed immediately after being brought into an emergency room from a trauma but he isn’t a doctor so he can just hope that it is done correctly to give his cousin the best chances and the best possible outcome once he is healed from the injuries. Robert stayed and talked for about an hour and a half. Robert went home to shower and get ready for bed. Robert was tired and wanted his brain to rest from all the thoughts today so after his shower he decided to lie in the dark and put on an audible book.

### Thursday Morning

Thursday morning, 10/12/2023, Robert woke up early around 0230 hours to throw up and use the restroom. Robert noticed he had a text message on his phone and when he checked it, it was an order from Instacart that was being delivered today between 0800 – 1000 hours. Robert figured it was from Tonia to make sure he had groceries and everything he might need. Robert knew he was planning on coming home after his doctor’s appointment today, so he did not want to have a bunch of groceries sitting in his car in case the appointment took a while.

Robert could not see the order to see if stuff would be ruined from sitting out, he just seen there was an order. Robert called Instacart to cancel the order. Robert ordered Tonia and Jax a Shipt order yesterday to send them some little gifts to let them know he was thinking of them, so he figured the order was from Tonia.

Robert got up and started cleaning the house so it would be better when he left than when he arrived since his parent’s were nice enough to let him stay there on such short notice. Robert made sure the air was turned up and the water was shut off with the alarm set before leaving for his appointment since he knew he would not be coming back.

### Southeastern College

Robert went to Southeastern College campus to see his instructors and get some information on returning to school before going to the VA for his scheduled appointment. While at the school he spoke with one of his favorite instructors and also with the Dean to see what he needed to do to return on October 23,2023. Robert has a few things to get done to return to his externship, but he is going to try to get everything done to return in October but if not, he will return in November on the 20th.

After getting some instruction and paperwork Robert thanked his instructor for her time and he left campus to go to the VA. Robert arrived at the VA a few minutes later since it was only a short drive away. Robert checked in at the kiosk in the lobby and was called back almost as soon as he completed the kiosk. Robert completed the pulmonary test and was advised he would be contacted by the pulmonologist once the test was read.

Robert left the VA and was ready to drive home and see his family. Robert drove back to Aiken and once he was home Tonia said he had to keep his distance from Jax since his throat was still sore, but he did not have a fever anymore. Robert said that would be fine, he was just glad to be home. A relaxing weekend was planned since Robert and Jax were both not feeling really well. Tonia does everything she can to make them both happy and she is able to succeed at being a wonderful mother and an amazing partner. Robert knows he has to get out of his head and know his path is the correct path and everything will work out as it is supposed to because he truly knows it is meant to be. Life doesn’t go as planned but life has a plan for you that God knows you can handle and will maximize your qualities to the best of their abilities to make a great life for yourself and the one you’re with. Make a plan if you want but stay strong and live the plan provided.
