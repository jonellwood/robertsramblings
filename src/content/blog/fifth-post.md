**A Restless Night and an Early Start**

Robert woke up in the early morning hours of Thursday, August 3, 2023, after a restless night of mind wondering and feeling pain from his chest from the procedure yesterday. Robert looked at the clock to see what time it was, and he noticed it was already 0515 hours. Robert wanted to get up at 0500 hours to make sure he was able to leave by 0530 hours since he had to drive downtown in morning traffic. Robert rushed to get ready to still leave on time.

**On the Road to MOSL**

Robert was on the road a few minutes past 0530 hours, but he had enough time to make the 0700 hours appointment as long as traffic was not that bad. The drive was good with little traffic, so Robert arrived at MOSL at 0647 hours. As Robert was parking his car, he thought about being alone at his first treatment. The night before Robert spoke to his parents and girlfriend to let them know how his procedure went and that he had someone with him to drive after he was completed with the treatment today.

**Facing the First Treatment Alone**

Robert did not have anyone with him though. Robert told his parents his girlfriend was coming but she got sick and could not make it. Robert never told his parents that she was unable to make it because he did not want to inconvenience anyone to have to drive to Charleston. When his girlfriend told him she could not make it, Robert told her it was fine because he could get someone to drive him. Robert finally parked and walked into MOSL to check in.

**Arrival at the Infusion Center**

Robert went to the second floor which was where the infusion center was located to let them know he was on time for his appointment. After checking in he was told to have a seat and a nurse would be out shortly. Trying to keep his mind idle Robert played on his phone until someone came out to get him.

**The Initial Assessment**

20 minutes later a nurse called his name and asked him to follow her. The nurse stated she was going to get his vitals and draw blood to have labs done. Robert followed the nurse into an exam room and had a seat in the chair so she could do everything that she needed to do. The nurse asked Robert if this was his first chemotherapy appointment, Robert stated it was. The nurse asked Robert if he had a port, Robert told her that he did, and it was just put in yesterday. The nurse said that was good because it makes the process faster and easier.

**Port Access and Lidocaine Cream**

Robert lifted his shirt to allow the nurse to access the port. The nurse grabbed a needle that was attached to a backing and tube. The nurse asked Robert if he was given any lidocaine cream after getting his port placed, Robert said he did not. The nurse said she would tell the doctor so he could get a prescription for the cream. She said it would help with the pain when getting labs or being connected in the infusion center.

The nurse told Robert to put the cream on his port an hour before his appointment so it would be numb by the time he arrived. After she finished telling Robert about the cream, she told him he would feel a sharp pain and some pressure while she inserted the needle. As the needle went into the port Robert felt the sensation, she described but it was brief. After a few minutes the needle was removed, and the nurse stated she was done.

**Consultation with the Doctor and Pharmacist**

She told Robert to go back out to the lobby and wait for the doctor to see him. Robert returned to the waiting room. Robert waited about 30 minutes before his doctor came out to speak to him. The doctor introduced herself along with introducing the other lady with her who was a pharmacist. The doctor talked to Robert about the four chemotherapy drugs he would be receiving along with the side effects. She provided Robert with a sheet of paper that had everything on it that she was discussing with him. The doctor asked if he had any questions, he said he could not think of any at this time. The doctor said she would let the pharmacist explain all the medications he was being prescribed. The pharmacist told Robert he would be getting several medications to take after he completes his treatment.

Each medication was explained with all the information of how to take it, when to take it, and what it was for along with the side effects of each. The prescribed medication was the following: Albuterol, Trazodone, Acyclovir, Loratadine, Ondansetron, Gabapentin, Famotidine, and Prednisone. Robert told the pharmacist he understood the instructions. The doctor said she would send the prescriptions in so they could be picked up after he is done with his treatment. Robert asked where the prescriptions would be sent, she said she would send it to MOSL pharmacy and the VA pharmacy.

After about an hour of talking with the pharmacist and doctor, the doctor told him to go check in with the infusion center and he would be called to start his treatment. Robert walked to the infusion center and as he was walking towards the desk, he observed other patients receiving treatment in individual spaces and a row of treatment chairs that were side by side. Robert provided his information to the nurse at the desk. The nurse told Robert the order for his drugs would be placed and he would be called back shortly to get started.

**Observations in the Infusion Waiting Area**

Once Robert checked in with the infusion center, he walked out to the infusion waiting area. Robert sat down to wait for his turn. Robert was looking around the waiting area as he did, he observed several people that appeared to be there for treatment as well. Robert knew his story and was trying to think of each person’s story wondering if it was the same as his or if they had different stories to tell for their current situation. Robert didn’t speak to anyone because it was kind of a gloomy atmosphere and each person was doing something rather it was talking with their family, reading, or playing on their phones. Robert only sat in the waiting area for approximately 15 minutes or so before his name was called, and he was escorted to his infusion chair.

**Infusion Chair 29**

Robert followed the nurse to infusion chair 29 which was located in an individual space with a window. Robert took a seat in the chair and as he was doing so the nurse asked him if he wanted the blinds opened or closed on the window. Robert said open please.

**Meeting the Nurse**

The nurse introduced herself and told Robert that she would be providing his treatment today. Robert asked how long the treatment would take, she stated between 5 and 6 hours. The nurse asked Robert if he wanted anything to drink, Robert said he did and after getting told the options he decided on a cranberry juice. The nurse left for a moment to get the juice and when she returned, she asked Robert if he was nervous, Robert stated he was just because he did not know what to expect and was unsure at how the process went. The nurse said she would give him something to help relax. She left once again and returned with a pill (Xanax) and said it would help calm him down so he would not be tense and nervous during the treatment.

**Preparing for Treatment**

The nurse told Robert she was waiting for his drugs to be delivered from the main hospital so they can begin. The nurse connected an IV to Robert’s port and told him she was giving him Zofran to help with nausea. The nurse handed Robert the tv remote and said she would be back in 20 minutes when the IV is done but if he needed anything before then she showed him the call button on the tv remote. Robert got comfortable in the chair and looked through the guide on the tv before deciding on mysteries at the museum.

**Beginning of Chemotherapy**

Time was seeming to creep by as Robert waited the 20 minutes for the current IV bag to finish. The bag finally finished causing the IV machine to start beeping. As soon as it started the nurse returned and removed the Zofran bag and hung saline to flush the line before starting with the chemotherapy. The saline flushed the line for a few minutes as the nurse was preparing the chemo drugs.

The nurse started hanging the first chemo bag which was Cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide is a drug that stops or slows down the growth of cancer cells. It is known as an alkylating agent that works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells.

**Feeling the Effects**

Robert could feel the fluid going throughout his body or at least he thought he could because he started getting cold. The nurse asked if he wanted a blanket, Robert told her that would be great. A warm blanket was given to Robert so he could cover up to stay warm.

**Support from Dad**

While the first drug was being administered Robert’s dad walked into the room and asked how he was doing. Robert told him he was good. Robert asked his dad why he came, his dad said he didn’t need to be alone. He said if he knew his girlfriend wasn’t coming, he would have come last night to be with him this morning.

Robert’s dad asked what all happened so far, Robert told him and said he just started the treatment regimen. The nurse checked in frequently to see if Robert needed anything and to see how he was doing. Robert and his dad talked and watched mysteries at the museum.

**Grateful for Companionship**

Robert thought to himself that he was glad someone was able to come but he felt bad because his dad had to take off work to do so. Robert felt a bit better since he had someone there and could talk or just spend time with them while he was stuck in the infusion chair. Having someone present was a lot better than just having thoughts of the actual situation while he sat by himself.

**The Unwelcome but Necessary Shot**

After about an hour and a half the nurse told Robert the next drug would be given as a shot in his belly. Robert repeated the word shot to her and said he didn’t know he would be getting any shots. Robert told the nurse he wasn’t a fan of any kind of shot. The nurse said it saves a lot of time by being able to take the shot rather than having it done as an IV.

**Choosing Sides**

The nurse asked Robert what side of his belly he wanted to get the shot on, Robert told her if he has no choice he guessed the left side, so she did not have to walk as far to get to his right side plus the IV pole was in the way. The nurse laughed and said okay.

**Introduction to Rituximab**

The nurse uncapped the needle and told Robert it was Rituximab. Rituximab is not actually a chemotherapy drug, but it goes with the overall treatment. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody, which is a man-made protein that’s been engineered to find cancer cells and help the immune system destroy them. The needle was inserted into Robert’s belly and the Rituximab was injected. The nurse said the next drug is Doxorubicin Hydrochloride. She said it is also in a syringe, but it is pushed through the IV line.

**The Infamous "Red Devil"**

Robert remembered Doxorubicin because it has the nickname of the <mark class="red-mark">red devil</mark>. Robert really didn’t know why it had such a horrible nickname for a medicine but when he read articles it would be referred to as red devil sometimes.

**The Red Devil's Arrival**

The nurse returned and she was holding two large syringes filled with a red fluid. Robert laughed to himself and thought he now understood the red part of the nickname. The nurse pushed one of the large syringes into the IV line and started pressing the plunger. As she pressed the plunger, she pulled back on it and said she had to make sure she saw blood to know it was being properly administered. This drug took a while considering it was being pushed through a syringe, but she said it has to be pushed slow, Robert said _'obviously'_.

**The Red Fluid's Journey**

Robert was watching the nurse as she pushed on the syringe but started thinking about that red fluid going throughout his body and what it was doing as it traveled around. Robert didn’t like the way he was starting to think so he shifted his focus back to the tv to see what the mystery was at the museum hoping he hadn’t seen the episode before. The nurse was finally finished with both syringes of the red devil after 25 or 30 minutes that seemed like a few hours. The nurse said just one more to go and she was going to get it, she said it was Vincristine. The nurse came back gowned and gloved as she hung the final drug on the IV pole.

**Understanding Vincristine**

Vincristine is a drug that stops or slows down the growth of cancer cells by stopping the cells from dividing and making new cells. It’s a type of drug known as a vinca alkaloid.

**A Slow Drip of Discomfort**

The bag started to drip, and it couldn’t drip fast enough since Robert was starting to feel bad and tired of being in the infusion chair. Robert thought only so many mysteries at the museums around the world can be interesting to captivate his attention, but he was done with mysteries for the day.

Robert’s dad asked him how he was doing, Robert stated he was alright but was feeling a bit ill or nauseated. Robert’s stomach was hurting like a feeling someone might have after eating something bad.

**An Inquisitive Gaze**

Robert had his papers from the doctor this morning on the small table next to his chair which his dad noticed and started looking at. Robert’s dad asked if the doctor went over all of the information with him, Robert told him she did before he started the treatment.

**Reviewing medications**

Robert’s dad continued to read and then stopped again asking about the prescriptions. Robert said he was prescribed a few and they were sent to MOSL and the VA pharmacies. Robert looked at the medication list with his dad and tried to remember everything the pharmacist told him about each.

**A Quick Pharmacy Visit**

Robert’s dad stated he was going to walk to the pharmacy to pick up the prescriptions for him. It didn’t take long for Robert’s dad to go to the pharmacy and return. All the prescriptions were filled.

**A Generous Gesture**

Robert asked his dad how much the prescriptions were, and he said not to worry about it. Robert thinks he is going to be in debt to a lot of people since he is probably not going to be able to work during his treatment.

Robert’s parents are always there for him, and he never gets the chance to repay them, but he usually tries his hardest not to ask for money. Robert has always worked and never really needed money or a lot of help, so this was new to him as far as treatment, working, activities, and just life in general.

The final bag was finished and the IV machine started to beep to alert the nurse it was done. Just like the first time the alarm sounded the nurse was on top of it and walked in immediately. The nurse took off all the connections and told Robert he was done but needed to see the front desk to schedule his next appointment before leaving.

**An Express of Gratitude**

Robert said he would and thanked the nurse for all her time and generosity today. She said it was her pleasure and she hopes he feels good and continues to improve.

**The Role of Prednisone**

The nurse also reminded Robert to make sure he took the Prednisone starting today and to take it for 5 days following the treatment because it helps the body work with the other chemotherapy drugs. Robert said yes ma’am that is the P in R-CHOP for his treatment plan, the nurse said _'yes, it is'_ and smiled.

**Scheduling the Next Appointment**

Robert and his dad walked out of the infusion area to the front desk to check out and schedule his next appointment. As Robert was speaking to the lady at the desk his doctor walked by and asked how he was feeling, Robert said alright besides being a little nauseated. She asked if he got his prescriptions, he told her he did. The doctor told him to take a Zofran. The lady at the desk asked Robert if he preferred a certain day of the week. Robert stated Thursdays are fine. The lady said Thursday, August 24, 2023, at the same time 0700 hours. Robert was handed a piece of paper with the appointment information on it. After that Robert was finally ready to leave MOSL and head home.

**A Pause for Relief**

Robert stopped by the water fountain on the way out to take the Zofran as the doctor recommended. Robert also had to use the restroom, so he walked into the men’s room and stood at a urinal to urinate. Robert happened to glance down while he was urinating and observed his urine to be red. It was a clear kind of red not a solid red, so he knew it wasn’t blood, but he wasn’t sure what it was at first until he mentioned it to his dad and his dad said the paperwork mentioned Doxorubicin could cause that. Robert smiled and said oh yeah, it is the red devil. Robert and his dad returned home.

**Nausea and Reflection**

Once home Robert was still feeling nauseated and was not hungry even though he hadn’t eaten since yesterday, 8/2/2023, at 1700 hours and it was now 1800 hours, 25 hours later. Robert told his parents he was going to lay down to see if he would feel better.

**The Weight of the Unknown**

As Robert laid in bed, he was thinking about how his body would react to the chemotherapy and if the chemotherapy would help him. The fear for Robert comes from the unknown. Robert is fine if he knows what’s going on and has some control over what happens but, in this instance, he knows he has no control over anything that has to do with this cancer that has somehow invaded his body. Robert’s girlfriend always tells him not to put negative thoughts out in the universe, but Robert finds that hard to do sometimes especially when he is trying to process his current situation.

**Embracing Tomorrow**

As hours passed while Robert was thinking of what caused his condition, what will happen due to this illness, if the treatment will help him, the cancer can spread to other parts of his body, who will attend his funeral, and how long before he loses his hair. Eventually Robert dozed off to sleep not knowing what tomorrow would bring _but knowing there would be a tomorrow_.
