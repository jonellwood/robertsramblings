#### Alone in Bonneau

Robert was in Bonneau by himself for the first three days after his treatment since he had to take precautions not to get sick since Jax was not feeling well at his house. Those three days were rough but at least Robert did not have to worry about making anyone upset while he was not feeling good and taking his steroids.

#### Managing Nausea and Discomfort

Robert was nauseated each day while in Bonneau, but he limited what he ate so when he did get sick it wasn’t horrible since he was eating mostly popsicles and not eating any big meals or anything that would sit heavy on his stomach. Robert had the uncomfortable burning sensation in his bones and was fatigued.

#### Exercise for Pain Relief

The fatigue Robert knew was unpreventable, but for the pain in his bones he knew if he would make himself walk or be active his bones would not hurt as badly so for the two evenings, he was in Bonneau he went for a walk to get some exercise. Walking helped with the pain which Robert knew it would do, the hardest part of helping the pain is actually making himself walk when he feels so tired and fatigued from doing nothing.

#### Learning and Adapting

As each treatment had passed Robert had learned something to help him out with certain issues caused by the chemotherapy medication. Now that he is halfway through his treatment, he is starting to get the hang of what he needs to do or can do to make each day better and not let the drugs affect him as much as they did at the start of this journey.

#### Returning to Aiken

After Robert’s three days at the house by himself, he decided he was going to go back to Aiken after his VA appointment on Thursday, 10/12/2023. Robert had been gone from home for half the week, but he knew he had to return on Thursday for the appointment that his primary care doctor scheduled. Robert tried to schedule the appointment for the same day as his treatment but was unable to since it was Columbus Day.

#### Frustration with the Appointment

Robert was frustrated with the appointment altogether because his oncology doctors wanted him to see a pulmonologist for the issue he was having with his lungs and the cough, but when he contacted his primary care doctor about a referral, the doctor said he wanted to do some tests and take some scans. Robert already did tests and scans which told his oncology doctors, who see him every three weeks, there might be a problem, but his primary care doctor wanted to do his own thing and not go off of the previous results even though his primary care doctor had not seen him in months.

#### VA Appointment

Robert checked in to his appointment and was called back immediately to get started with the pulmonary testing. After Robert was completed with the ordered pulmonary test, he went for a CT scan, and when he was done with that, the nurse said his primary care doctor would be notified. The nurse said Robert would hear something in a week or so after his primary care doctor gets with a pulmonologist about his scan and tests.

#### Headed home

Robert thought this appointment was a big waste of time and money since the workup was previously done, and he just needed a referral, but he thought it is what it is, and it is done now. Robert was glad to be done wasting his time so he could head back to Aiken. Robert walked out of the VA and to his car so he could get in the Charleston traffic since it was 1445 hours and drive back.

#### Gas for Under $3.00

While Robert was driving home, he saw gas for under $3.00 so that made him happy since it had been months since gas had been so cheap. Robert didn’t really need gas but how could he turn down gas for $2.86. Robert stopped at Circle K and filled his car with fuel.

#### Arriving Back in Aiken

Once his vehicle was topped off, he continued on his drive until he arrived back in Aiken around 1700 hours. Tonia was still working when Robert got home, and Jax was lying down since he was not feeling well. Tonia told Robert she cleaned the house and disinfected it so the germs would be at a minimum, but she told Robert and Jax to keep their distance from each other.

#### Settling Back In

Robert brought his bags in to unpack and settle back in after being gone a few days. Robert was hurting a little from the drive and being stuck in the seated position, so he did a few things around the house to get moving and exercise his bones a little. Robert piddled around with his daily tasks that he had not been able to do until Tonia got off work.

#### Dinner and Evening

Robert asked Tonia if she had any plans for dinner, and she said she did not, so Robert made some chicken and spaghetti. That evening after they ate, Jax laid in his room resting while Tonia and Robert sat in the living room watching TV. Tonia took Friday, 10/13/2023, off to spend time with Jax since it was his last day of fall break.

#### Resting Day and Plans for the Weekend

Robert, Tonia, and Jax watched movies most of the day since the weather was cold and rainy. Robert had to run to his parent’s house that afternoon for a minute, but other than that, nobody left the house. Robert was feeling alright most of the day besides a little nausea, but it wasn’t unmanageable. Jax was starting to feel better as well, but he was not 100 percent, so Tonia decided they would miss REC in the morning to continue to rest so everyone would be better come Monday. Robert told Tonia Sunday, 10/15/2023, was community day for Pokémon, and he was going to ask Myla if she wanted to come with them if they went somewhere to walk. Tonia said that was fine and told him to text her mother. Jax asked if he was going to get to go with them, Robert told him of course if he was feeling better.

#### Grocery Shopping and College Football

Saturday morning, Robert went to Kroger to go grocery shopping. Robert and Tonia talked about making chicken soup the night before since the broth would be good for Robert and Jax. After Robert went shopping, he returned home to start cooking and watch college football. Robert and Tonia both enjoy college football, so if nothing is planned, most Saturdays are spent relaxing and watching football.

#### Decorations and Game Time

Robert put the chicken on so he could slow cook it and made a pan of Jello-O for Jax since his throat was still bothering him. Tonia was working on Halloween decorations and picking up some in the front yard that had blown out of the tree the previous day when it was windy. Robert asked Tonia if she wanted him to put the decorations back in the tree. She said no but told him he could hold the ladder for her. Robert said okay and footed the ladder while she hung several Halloween monsters back in the tree. As the food was cooking and Tonia and Robert were in and out of the house, the Georgia Bulldog game was on. Georgia playing Vanderbilt didn’t seem like it would be a close game, so they were okay with multitasking while watching it.

#### Football Fandom and Evening Walk

Robert is a South Carolina fan, but he likes Georgia because they are in the SEC, and it is Tonia’s team, so he will cheer for them as long as they are not playing the Gamecocks. Tonia told Robert that Carolina plays at 1530 hours, so it would be on after the Georgia game. Tonia is definitely not a Carolina fan, but she at least lets Robert watch them. As they watched the game, it was a close one, which is never good for Carolina, Robert thought. At the end, Carolina was up by 3 and had Florida with a fourth and long to end the game, but in good ol’ Carolina fashion, they gave up the first down followed by a touchdown. There were still like 45 seconds left in the game, but Robert asked Tonia if she wanted to go for a walk, she said sure. Robert, Tonia, and Jax went for an evening walk around the neighborhood to get some exercise and fresh air since the time outside had been limited by the weather the past two days. The walk really helped Robert, and he told Tonia how good walking makes him feel, and she said they needed to try and walk more. Robert told her that would be great.

#### Pre-Bedtime Routine

Robert tried not to think about the last 45 seconds of the game, but he did wonder if Carolina was able to score. When they got back home, Jax took a shower and asked Robert if he was going to get to go walk tomorrow. Robert told him as long as he is feeling good, but he couldn’t fake it because he had to go back to school on Monday, 10/16/2023. Robert told Jax he should get a good night sleep to make sure he was good to go by tomorrow. After Jax completed his nightly routine, he told Tonia and Robert he was ready for bed. Tonia and Robert went to say prayers and tuck him in.

#### Saturday Evening and Night

Robert wanted to watch two of the night games but after they were both blowouts in the first half, he told Tonia they could watch something else. Tonia put on Billions. Robert and Tonia both fell asleep early that Saturday night.

#### Sunday Morning Plans

Sunday morning when Robert woke up, he asked Tonia if she wanted breakfast since she mentioned Hardees earlier in the weekend. Tonia said she did, Robert told her he would make her a bacon and egg sandwich and it’d be ready by 0930 hours. Robert knows Tonia doesn’t like getting up early, so he knew not to go make it as soon as he got up.

#### Checking on Jax

Robert peeked into Jax’s room to check on him, and he was awake watching TV. As soon as Robert opened the door, he asked if he was going to go for a walk for community day. Robert asked how he was feeling, he said he felt good. Robert noticed he did look better and sounded better.

#### Morning Chores and Plans

Robert told him since he was feeling better, he needed to get his chores done, and they would be leaving by 1330 hours. Robert went to the kitchen to start on breakfast and gather his thoughts from what was a great weekend. Robert had a rough start to the week, but his mental health was not perfect, but it wasn’t as bad as it had been during the first week following treatment and taking the steroids.

#### Room Inspection and Breakfast

Robert proceeded to cook breakfast, and as he was cooking, Jax came into the kitchen and asked Robert if he wanted to go look at his room. Robert told him he would as soon as he was finished. Robert asked Jax if he wanted breakfast, he said he did not. Jax said he had pudding for breakfast.

#### Jax's Room and Costumes

Robert finished Tonia’s breakfast sandwich and made her a water that he set on the table on the way to wake her up and look at Jax’s room. Jax did a great job cleaning his room and he even did his bathroom without being told. Robert told Jax he did a great job, and they would be leaving in a little while to go to Augusta Riverfront to walk.

#### Plans for the Day

Jax asked if Myla was still coming with them, Robert told him he asked her mother, but he hadn’t heard anything since Friday. Tonia got up and ate breakfast which she said was delicious. While she was eating, Jax came out and said he was hungry and wanted a breakfast sandwich, Robert smiled because he literally just asked him 15 minutes before. Tonia gave Jax half of her sandwich since he was all of a sudden hungry for a bacon and egg sandwich. Tonia ordered their Halloween costumes that morning and Robert started working on a staff that could be carried by Jax since he was going to be a jester. They have staffs that you can buy but it was almost as much as the costume so Robert being Robert said we can make one. Then at 1300 hours, Robert, Tonia, and Jax started getting ready to go so they could leave the house by 1330 hours. Tonia said she spoke with Myla’s mom who said she was at a friend’s house, so she was not going to go with them.

#### Community Day

They left the house right on time as scheduled so they would get to Riverfront at 1400 hours when community day officially starts. Robert and Jax Pokémon but Tonia doesn’t but she still comes to spend time with both of them and get her steps.

#### Improvement in the Week

Robert was so glad the end of his week was so much better than the beginning. Robert’s pain was minimal with all the walking he was doing, and his mind and mentality were not perfect, but it also wasn’t horrible, so he took that as a win.

#### Family Day Out

Robert, Tonia, and Jax walked the Riverfront for an hour and then went to the Greenway in North Augusta for an hour. While they were walking Robert got a text from his friend whose wife had her birthday party Saturday night. Robert did not go since he tries to stay away from crowds or large gatherings of people, so he doesn’t get sick or extend his treatment by any means. His friend said he was going to drop off three plates for them since he did not make the party, Robert told him they were not home at the moment, and he said it was fine he would set it on the porch.

#### Surprise Gifts

That evening after a great family day out together when they got back home Robert noticed a silver object on one of the skeletons on the porch as he pulled into the driveway. As Robert walked towards the front door he noticed a bunch of food, the plate covered with foil, and a CVS bag. Robert’s friend dropped off three plates of food, a huge piece of birthday cake, and brought Robert several bags of candy. Robert smiled and thought only a few people would know what to get him to make him smile. Robert sent his friend a text to thank him.

#### Week's End

The week started badly, but it gradually got better and better each day. Robert wasn’t close to being 100 percent but being the first week following a treatment it felt like it could have been because he did not have much physical pain and he was able to control most of the thoughts and mind cloudiness. The week ended with a great weekend. Robert hopes his physical and mental health continue to improve as he counts down the weeks until treatment five and he can say one more to go.
