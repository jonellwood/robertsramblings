#### Resuming Routine with Discomfort

After Robert's visit to the emergency room, he attempted to resume his daily life routine, which included part-time work and attending school. However, he continued to experience persistent pain in his abdomen. Robert pondered possible ways to alleviate the discomfort stemming from his enlarged spleen but found no clear solutions. Uncertain whether the spleen would naturally reduce in size or if medication would be required, Robert had to adapt to his current situation and maintain hope that the doctors would provide a solution.

**Seeking Help from Instructors**

In his pursuit to find answers for his pain, Robert decided to confide in his school instructors who were well-versed in human anatomy and organs, given his program of study in surgical technology. They had noticed his struggles in the lab, with Robert often dropping to a knee to cope with the pain and catch his breath. Concerned for his well-being, the instructors inquired about the tests the doctors had conducted to identify a solution.

Robert shared that he had undergone bloodwork, an ultrasound, a CT scan, and a biopsy. The instructors informed him that the spleen might naturally reduce in size, depending on the cause of its inflammation. They also asked if Robert had received any information or results from his medical visit, to which he replied that he was still awaiting any updates.

Approximately two weeks after the biopsy, while Robert was at school, he received a phone call from Ralph Johnson Hospital. A female voice on the other end introduced herself and informed him that the results from the pathology were now available.

#### Receiving Life-Altering News

The doctor contacted Robert regarding the results of the biopsy. The doctor inquired if Robert could come to the hospital in person to discuss the findings, either on that same day, June 28, 2023, or later in the week. Despite his ability to make the time, Robert didn't want to wait in suspense, so he opted to receive the news over the phone.

As the conversation unfolded, Robert noticed a change in the doctor's tone. The doctor gently explained that the biopsy revealed abnormal cells within the tissue of the lump on the left side of Robert's neck, and these cells appeared to be malignant, multiplying and spreading. This devastating revelation left Robert teary-eyed. However, he had to maintain composure as he was standing in a school hallway.

**Facing a Challenging Path Ahead**

Robert took deep breaths, struggling to remain calm as he processed the life-changing information. The doctor emphasized the need to set up an appointment with an oncologist promptly to establish a treatment plan aimed at halting further damage. Robert acknowledged the doctor's instructions and prepared to receive a call from the oncologist to schedule the appointment.

Once the call concluded, Robert wiped his face and eyes, then returned to the classroom, trying to conceal the emotional turmoil he had just experienced. The instructor immediately noticed his distress and inquired about his well-being. Robert, choked up and unable to respond, exited the classroom, with the instructor following him to offer support.

In the office, Robert allowed himself to release his emotions, shedding tears as he tried to grasp the overwhelming news. His 40th birthday had also coincided with this distressing revelation. After taking a moment to collect himself, Robert re-entered the classroom, determined to continue the day without falling behind on his studies.

This marked the beginning of a challenging and life-altering journey for Robert.

#### A Race to Stay on Track

Robert took his seat and opened up his notebook to continue taking notes on the lecture as he was doing before receiving the phone call. Robert’s mind was racing for the rest of the day, but he was able to finish the day without missing anything. Upon arriving home Robert took a shower and just wanted to lay down. He was mentally exhausted and kind of wanted this day to be over.

**A Second Call**

Robert received a phone call from Ralph Johnson Hospital once again, and when he answered, it was the oncology department. An appointment was made for next week to go in to have some tests, labs, and discussion with the oncologist to see what the next course of action would be depending on the type of cancer Robert was suffering from.

**40th Birthday Blues**

Robert thought about how he was so concerned about turning 40. Robert was stressing his 40th birthday months prior just because he always thought 40 years old was old when he was younger and now, he was turning 40. Robert’s 40th birthday will always be a memorable one to him, not from an awesome party or a great gift but from his life changing because he received the news of having cancer cells in his body that needed to be addressed quickly. The news was bad but at least it was received, and it explained Robert’s symptoms he was suffering from that was causing him so much pain.
