### Early Monday morning

#### Morning Preparations

The early morning of Monday, October 9, 2023, Robert, and Tonia woke up to get ready to make the trip from Bonneau to Downtown Charleston for Robert’s fourth chemotherapy appointment.

#### Traffic Woes

Robert was thinking they did not need to leave as early as they usually did since today was Columbus Day, but he was wrong. It doesn’t matter what day or time it is there will always be traffic in this city. Robert and Tonia left at 0630 hours to make the 0800-hour appointment. They arrived at the parking garage at 0740 hours, so they had a little time to spare and did not have to rush to get checked in.

After the car was parked, they walked to the cancer center and went to the second floor to begin the check in process for the three appointments that were scheduled for today.

Robert walked up to the check in counter in the infusion center and provided his information. The lady at the counter checked Robert into all three appointments and asked if he knew where to go first, Robert said he did. The lady also asked Robert if he needed his parking ticket validated, Robert stated he did and handed her the ticket so it could be stamped and initialed.

#### Waiting for Labs

Once Robert was done at that counter, he walked to the back to check in again at the infusion desk since he would have his labs taken back there since he has a port. Robert provided his information again and the nurse said he would be called back shortly, and he could have a seat in the waiting area. Robert and Tonia walked down the hallway but there were no chairs, so they just stood by the window.

Robert and Tonia did not have to stand too long because Robert was called approximately 15 minutes after he checked in.

Robert followed the nurse to the lab room and had a seat in the chair. The nurse asked Robert how he was today, Robert said he was not feeling really good, but he was ready to get the day over with. Robert lifted his hoodie and shirt up and put them both behind his head to expose his chest so the nurse could access his port.

The nurse wiped off Robert’s chest since there was a clump of lidocaine cream that Robert remembered to put on the port site before leaving the house this morning. After she wiped the port site, she cleaned it and grabbed the needle to access it. The nurse counted down from three and said small poke, counting it down always makes it worse.

Robert always wonders why they don’t just do it whenever so it’s unexpected and might be less stressful. Robert felt the pressure of the needle going in, but it did not hurt as bad as last time since he had the numbing cream on it for a while.

The nurse proceeded to fill all the vials she needed with a limited amount of talking since Robert already said he wasn’t feeling well. Once the nurse was done, she left the site accessed for Robert to have his infusion, the tube was taped to his chest to keep it from being pulled out.

Robert walked to get Tonia and tell her they had to go to the front to wait to be seen by the doctor. Robert and Tonia went to the other waiting area where they were able to find chairs while they waited for Robert to be called.

#### Treatment Anxiety

As Robert was waiting, he was feeling anxious and not wanting to have the treatment today since he had felt better than he had in months. Robert knew as soon as the treatment started his good feeling would go away and he would be back feeling nauseated, sick, tired, fatigued, and having bone pain. Robert was trying not to think about it, but it was difficult since it was almost time to start. Tonia was able to calm him a little just by letting him know she was there.

The tech called Robert’s name to take his vitals. Robert walked into the room where the tech took his weight, height, temperature, oxygen level, and blood pressure. When he was done, he returned to his chair and the tech said she would call him up again to walk him back to the exam room when the doctor was ready. Robert and Tonia waited for about 20 minutes before the tech called his name again and escorted them to the exam room. While waiting for the doctor to come in, nurse Tonya usually comes in to speak for a while, but she did not come into the exam room this time.

Dr. Greenwell walked in with the pharmacist and some other lady that he said was taking notes.

#### Health Assessment

Dr. Greenwell asked Robert how he was doing, Robert said he was feeling decent besides his ribs and a little coughing but a lot better than he was. Dr. Greenwell checked Robert’s neck, armpits, groin, and ankles feeling for any possibly swollen lymph nodes. When he was done Robert asked him if anything felt strange, he said no.

#### Light-hearted Medication Discussions

Dr. Greenwell asked Robert what medication he had been taking to try and control the cough. Robert told him everything he was prescribed in the last two visits but told him it doesn’t really help since he doesn’t have allergies.

Tonia and the pharmacist found that to be funny for some reason, but Robert still isn’t sure about this allergy thing. Dr. Greenwell just smiled because he didn’t get the joke since he hadn’t seen Robert since the beginning of his treatment.

Robert made a golf course joke for Dr. Greenwell, never seeing him or being at the hospital.

#### CT Scan Results and Plan

Dr. Greenwell told Robert he looked at his CT scans and his lungs had some abnormalities in them, but he was not that concerned about it at this point. Dr. Greenwell’s primary concern is the treatment of Robert’s lymphoma, so he wants to stay on course with the R-CHOP treatment. Dr. Greenwell told Robert he is going to order a whole-body PET scan a day before his next treatment so they can see exactly what is going on and how the chemotherapy has been affecting the lymph nodes all around his body.

Dr. Greenwell asked Robert if he had any questions, Robert said I do but it’s not related. Robert asked how he could get proof that he had chicken pox as a kid, Dr. Greenwell said he could order a varicella titer and it would show rather or not Robert’s body has the antibodies from having the vaccine or chicken pox. Robert thanked Dr. Greenwell and he said no problem, it’s been ordered. Dr. Greenwell asked if there was anything else, Robert said that was it.

Dr. Greenwell told Robert he was cleared to receive treatment today and he would notify the infusion center. Robert and Tonia exited the exam room and walked back to the check in counter in the infusion center. Robert provided his information once again and the nurse said he was checked in, but his appointment wasn’t until noon. Robert looked at his watch and it was 1020 hours. The nurse said they could go get something to eat or walk around if they wanted and to just let her know when they return.

Robert asked Tonia what she wanted to do, she said they could walk to the car to put some stuff in there. While walking to the car Robert said his appointments usually run together and are one after another. Robert asked Tonia if she was hungry, she said a little. Robert was a little hungry too and he knew this would be the last enjoyable chewing for the next few days.

#### Good thing there is a Subway

After they put the items in the car, they walked to the main hospital to go to the cafeteria. The time was 1040 hours, and the cafeteria was closed from 1000 to 1100 hours. Tonia said good thing there is a Subway. She said you like Subway so that’s good. Robert asked if Subway was good for her, she said yeah, she likes subway too. Tonia ordered a number 10 which was a turkey, ham, and bacon sub. Robert ordered his normal roasted turkey. Robert and Tonia both got cooler ranch Doritos to smash on to their subs for that extra crunch. Tonia also got three chocolate chip cookies that looked delicious. Robert and Tonia ate the sandwiches in the cafeteria.

When they finished eating it was only 1115 hours, so they decided to walk around for a bit before returning to the infusion center. They walked the block around the main hospital before returning to the cancer center. Robert advised the nurse at the infusion center counter that he was back and would be in the waiting room.

#### Infusion Chair 1

A few moments later Robert was called up and advised to follow the nurse to his infusion chair. Tonia and Robert followed the nurse to the big infusion room with the chairs lined up along the wall and across from each other. Robert took a seat in infusion chair 1. This chair was in the community room. Robert had private rooms for the first three treatments but not this time. Robert didn’t care where he was really but was a little disappointed there was no TV. It’s hard to sit anywhere for four hours with nothing to do so a TV helps time go by, but he and Tonia were discussing crafting ideas, so he had plenty to do. The nurse went and got Robert and Tonia a warm blanket as soon as they both sat down.

The nurse introduced herself and said she would be working with Robert today along with another nurse who she pointed to. The treatment routine went just like clockwork. The nurse hung a bag of fluid and brought Robert his Tylenol, Benadryl, and Zofran before starting the treatment.

After Robert took all the medication she went and got the Rituximab. The nurse asked Robert what side of his belly he wanted to receive the shot; Robert said his left since he got it in his right-side last time. Robert lifted his shirt to give the nurse access to his belly. The nurse pinched Robert’s belly and following a countdown she said poke and inserted the needle into his belly. The shot stings as she starts to administer the drug. Robert told the nurse they make him feel fat when they pinch such a large flap from his belly. The nurse said she was concerned about being able to give the shot since Robert does not have much body fat.

The nurse asked Robert what he did for exercise, Robert said he liked to run when he could. The nurse said she thought he was a bike rider and the other nurse thought he was a swimmer. Robert thought that was funny that they had done all that judging in 5 minutes. Robert thought he could just be lacking body fat from having cancer, just like most people in the chairs around him. It was a weird conversation Robert thought.

#### Ginger Ale Request

Once the Rituximab was finished there was a 30-minute observation period before the next drug was administered. The next drug would be Cyclophosphamide that is hung and dispensed through the IV. Each time the treatment goes the same way and in the same order. The Cyclophosphamide was followed by Doxorubicin Hydrochloride that is given through two huge syringes into the IV that is pushed by the nurse. This time Robert didn’t talk much kind of like last time because he was not feeling good and was dreading this red devil taking its effect on his body. The nurse sat next to him in her gown and pushed the drug and when it was completed Robert started feeling nauseated. Robert mentioned he wished he would have got a ginger ale from the guy that was walking around with the cart.

Tonia asked Robert if he wanted her to go find him and get him one. Robert told her she did not have to do that. Tonia said she would be back, she returned with a ginger ale. Tonia said she was unable to locate the guy with the cart, but a nurse asked what she wanted and when she said a ginger ale the nurse grabbed one from a refrigerator for her. Tonia poured the soda into the cup for Robert so he could drink it through the plastic straw and not from the metal can. Tonia always knows what to do and how to help Robert with the stuff she knows she can help with.

The nurse hung the final drug bag on the IV pole which was Oncovin. Robert was starting to doze on and off, which he felt bad for because he was talking about craft things he wanted to do with Tonia. Tonia was googling different items looking for ideas as her and Robert bounced ideas back and forth. That was until one side went silent, that would be Robert. Robert’s arms and legs were starting to tingle and burn as he was finishing up the final bag of chemo.

When the Oncovin was finished the nurse asked Robert what side he wanted his Neulasta body injector to go on. Robert said she could put it on his left arm since it has always been on his right arm the first three times. After the Neulasta was placed and went off to show it was prepared to dispense the medication in 27 hours Robert was ready to go. The nurses reminded Robert to take his steroids for the next 5 days starting today, Robert said thank you as he walked out.

Robert and Tonia walked to the main lobby to check out and set up the next appointment. The guy said the next appointment would be October 27, 2023. Robert said that was not a good day because Tonia had plans and he did not want to be sick for Halloween. Robert asked if it could be pushed to the end of that week. The guy asked what day Robert asked if the infusion can be on Thursday, November 2. 2023, and PET scan the day before on Wednesday, November 1, 2023. The guy said that would be fine as he typed on the computer entering the information.

#### After the Treatment

Once that was all figured out Tonia and Robert walked out of the cancer center from a successful fourth treatment. Robert was feeling really tired and fatigued but was tired of sitting down. He knew he was about to have to sit in the car for two and half hours for the drive back to Aiken. It is weird to feel tired but also be tired of sitting. Robert thought to himself he would not want to stand either so what could he do to help him rest. This was the stupid thought Robert was having as they were walking to the car because he really didn’t want to sit.

#### Jedburg is real!

Robert opened the driver door for Tonia since she was driving back to Aiken. Robert walked to the passenger side and reluctantly fell into the passenger seat.

Tonia asked Robert where she should stop to get fuel and water. Robert told her if she could wait it would be best to get out of the traffic and to Jedburg if possible.

Tonia said she could wait as they continued west on 26. When Tonia got to the Jedburg exit she told Robert she thought he was making that name up. Robert laughed and said nope it’s the actual name.

Tonia stopped at the Spinx and asked Robert if he wanted anything. Robert told her he was good but thanked her anyways. Tonia went in and of course got Robert water because he needed to drink fluids. Tonia got herself water as well.

#### Soda, burps, and pit stops

On the way home Tonia needed to burp and she was drinking a bunch of water, so she had to stop and use the restroom a few times during the drive back. When she stopped for a restroom, she bought a carbonated drink to try and help her burp. Drinking the soda was just more fluid so the restroom stops were continuing.

After the second or third stop she looked at Robert and told him he hadn’t gone to the restroom much today. Robert thought if she was comparing it to her current streak not many people have.

They finally made it back home around 2000 hours. Robert was ready to lay down but knew he needed to help unpack and put stuff away. Tonia emptied the car and brought everything in while Robert returned a phone call to his mother who had called while they were in the car.

Robert’s mom asked how the appointment went and how he was feeling. After the phone call Robert put the laundry in the washer, trying to help, but he forgot about a belt that was on Tonia’s jeans and she wanted to wash the bookbags and shoes, so Robert didn’t really help much but he tried.

Robert put some of the items they bought from Goodwill in the garage and then he walked back to their room where he lay on the bed for a few minutes. Tonia asked if he was going to bed, Robert said he was not, he was just resting for a few minutes.

Robert eventually got up and went to the living room to sit and spend time with Tonia. Tonia made Robert a bowl of soup. Robert was craving Chinese food for some odd reason knowing good and well he wouldn’t be able to keep it down especially on the day of treatment.

#### Packing and Uncertainty

Tonia made herself some pizza rolls which looked delicious and of course Robert couldn’t turn down a pizza roll so he had a couple of those along with his soup. Tonia’s mom told Tonia that Jax had a fever and was not feeling good. With Jax being sick Robert knew he would have to leave the house since he cannot take the chance of getting sick.

Robert packed a bag and Tonia said they would see how Jax was feeling in the morning before any plans were made.

#### The perfect way to end the day?

Robert and Tonia laid on the couch and watched TV until they ultimately fell asleep.
