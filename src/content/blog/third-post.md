#### Processing the News\*\*

Once the news was received and the appointments were set up with an oncologist, Robert began to process the situation. Despite the devastating news, Robert chose not to succumb to anger or frustration, recognizing it as unproductive.

**The Initial Appointment**

Robert's first appointment at Ralph Johnson Hospital with the oncologist shed light on his condition. The oncologist discussed Robert's bloodwork and shared the findings from the CT and PET scans.

**A Race Against Time**

The aggressive nature of the cancer was evident from the scans, prompting the need for swift treatment. Conversations revolved around determining the specific type of lymphoma, with initial suspicions of mantle cell lymphoma. In light of the potential diagnosis, the oncologist proposed transferring Robert to another hospital with specialized capabilities.

**Uncertain Times**

Facing an uncertain future, Robert contemplated the implications of this transfer and the next steps in his journey.

#### The Doctor's Proposition

Amid the awkward silence, the doctor raised the topic of transferring Robert, inquiring about his willingness to proceed.

**A Positive Transfer**

Robert expressed his consent to the transfer, confident that he would receive excellent care at MOSL. The doctor informed Robert about the transfer to the oncology team at MOSL and the readiness of their staff to receive him. Returning home, Robert contemplated the upcoming appointment at MOSL and the possibility of receiving a different perspective on his condition.

**Facing the Unknown**

With a sense of resolve, Robert embarked on his appointment at MOSL, unsure of the potential new insights into his condition.

#### MOSL Oncology Assessment

The MOSL oncologists introduced their selves and explained what they thought about the labs and scans. The primary oncologist advised he wanted to run a few more labs and test. He also told Robert he wanted to do another PET scan to check the measurements of the multiple enlarged lymph nodes and he wanted to have another biopsy done to pinpoint the type of lymphoma. Robert was sent to the main hospital to have his blood drawn for the labs and tests. Once that was completed Robert was sent to another building to schedule a time a biopsy could be done at the doctor’s request. As Robert was waiting to make an appointment the oncologist’s nurse called his cell phone and told him the biopsy could be done today.

Robert told the nurse he was currently sitting in the waiting room, the nurse stated she knew that, and she just got of the phone with the doctor that made time to do the biopsy today. Robert hung up the phone and moments later he was called back to a procedure room where he was told to have a seat on the table. As Robert sat on the table waiting for someone to come in and talk with him, he observed a nurse bring in sterile equipment on a mayo stand. Robert asked if the biopsy was going to be done in here, the nurse stated it was. The sterile pack was opened, Robert noticed local anesthesia and biopsy punches. Robert started feeling nervous as soon as he observed the stuff for the biopsy to be done.

**Facing the Biopsy Procedure**

This was the second time punches would be taken from his neck. It was a painful procedure, and it caused a level of discomfort that was aggravating. Robert calmed himself by saying it has to be done to get the answers needed to begin treatment. The doctor entered and confirmed Robert’s identity and had him sign a consent form prior to beginning on the procedure. Local anesthetic was shot into the left side of Robert’s neck and after waiting a few minutes the doctor advised the procedure was ready to begin. She told Robert the biopsy punch would make a loud noise when activated, Robert giggled and said he was aware. He thought I’ve had this done before and I am around punches in the operating room. The doctor took five punches from the swollen lymph node on Robert’s neck. Once the procedure was done Robert left and returned to the oncology department. The oncologist told Robert his PET scan was scheduled for July 17, 2023. Robert said that was fine.

The morning of July 17, 2023, Robert arrived at MOSL to have his PET scan. Robert was walked to the back and given the radiation material injection required prior to the PET scan. After the injection was done Robert had to wait thirty minutes before he was taken to the PET scan. Robert sat playing on his phone trying to keep his mind busy, so he did not think about what was actually happening. Thirty minutes passed and a nurse walked into the room and asked Robert if he was ready. Robert stated as ready as he will ever be, the nurse assisted Robert into a wheelchair and escorted him to the PET scan.

Once in the PET scan room Robert was helped onto the table and positioned by the radiology technician. The radiology technician talked Robert through the entire scan and asked if he had any questions, Robert advised he did not. The radiology technician asked Robert if he wanted a blanket before beginning, Robert said yes please since he was freezing and had been since he was walked to the back to begin this whole process. Robert was covered up and the PET scan began. After the scan was done Robert was contacted by the oncologist’s nurse who told Robert he was going to be admitted to the hospital today. The nurse said the doctor wanted to monitor him and continue to run test to try to ease the abdominal pain and get a better diagnosis for the type of lymphoma.

### Robert was admitted to the Hospital

Robert was admitted to MOSL. Tests and labs were done all day long a few times each day. Robert was given pain medicine to help with his abdominal pain. After two days of being in the hospital the oncologist came in and spoke with Robert about the test, scans, labs, and biopsy. The oncologist said he believed the lymphoma was diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The oncologist stated he wanted to do another biopsy of Robert’s neck. Robert said no, Robert told him he had already done two biopsies that should have provided more than enough samples to be looked at to determine the type of lymphoma. Robert said no matter what he said he was not agreeing to a third biopsy. The oncologist asked Robert about a bone marrow biopsy. Robert thought this doctor just wants to do a biopsy on something. Robert said no at first but then the oncologist explained his reason for wanting the biopsy. After hearing the information Robert agreed to the bone marrow biopsy. Two doctors walked in minutes later and told Robert they would be doing his biopsy. Robert was asked to lay on his belly so the biopsy could be taken from his iliac crest. Local anesthetic was given to help with the pain as the procedure was being conducted. The doctor pushed the needle deep into Robert’s lower back to get a piece of bone from his iliac crest. Robert could feel the pressure from the needle as it was being pushed and when it hit his bone it shot a sharp pain throughout his body. Robert was thinking this was taking forever and it was extremely painful. After the piece of bone was removed a vial of blood was drawn up then the procedure was done. Robert was bandaged up and told he could turn back over to his back in 15 minutes.

Robert was in pain the remainder of the day from his abdomen and from the bone biopsy that was causing his lower back to be sore. The next morning the oncologist returned and told Robert he was going to give him some chemotherapy medicine to assist with the abdomen pain in hopes it would help shrink his spleen. The exact treatment was still being determined from the multiple tests and labs but the oncologist told Robert there are two main chemotherapy medicines that will help with any kind of cancer so he will get some benefit from the medicine. That evening Robert was given his first dose of chemotherapy medicine. When the chemotherapy bag was hung on the IV poll the situation got more real than it was before. Robert still did not know what to think or do about this whole thing but seeing the chemotherapy bag took it to another level for him. The administration of the chemotherapy drugs started, and the nurse checked on Robert every 15 minutes to make sure his vitals were maintaining, and his body was able to handle the drug. This abbreviated course of treatment lasted for approximately three hours. At the conclusion Robert was extremely tired and felt a little ill from an upset stomach. The nurse told Robert he could rest now, and she would bring him something for his upset stomach. The nurse returned with Zofran.

### Robert was finally able to doze

Robert was able to doze off for a few hours before being woke up for his morning blood draw on day four of his hospital stay. The doctors returned to Robert’s room today with news of treatment options. The doctors told Robert his course of treatment for diffuse large B cell lymphoma would be what is known as R/CHOP. Robert looked at each doctor with a confused look so they would all understand he had no idea what that stood for. The primary oncologist grabbed a marker and started drawing on the window to help explain the treatment to Robert. The oncologist wrote R, and said it stood for Rituxan. then he wrote the word CHOP and said it was Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone. Robert laid looking at the window with the acronym and thought to himself how to you get CHOP from C, D, V and P but at least the R made sense. Robert decided not to ask a bunch of questions because he was aggravated with being in the hospital along with not feeling well and being tired from the night before. The oncologist continued to explain the treatment plan to Robert. After the medicine was explained the regimen was explained as being ever 21 days Robert would be required to return to the hospital for treatment. The doctors said this is usually scheduled for 6 to 8 cycles. The good news is Robert finally had a treatment plan with the exact medicine and the schedule to have it completed. It took a lot of labs, tests, and scans but Robert knew it was worth it because who would want a doctor to guess at the type of treatment based on a possibility of a diagnosis. The doctor asked Robert if he felt any relief in his abdomen from the medicine he received last night, Robert told him he still felt a little discomfort, but it was not as painful as it had been for months prior. The doctor told Robert he was going to be discharged from the hospital today, but he was scheduled for his first official chemotherapy treatment on Friday, August 4, 2023. The doctor also told Robert he was scheduled to have a port placed two days prior to his treatment on Wednesday, August 2, 2023. Robert advised the doctor he would put the appointments on his calendar. Robert thanked the doctors for all their time and effort they put into his diagnosis to make sure he received the best possible care. The more Robert gets into each doctor appointment the fact of having cancer gets more real each time and it’s a whirlwind of emotion that is impossible to express because it’s so much at one time on so many levels. Robert was always told to look at the positive and take small victories, this sums up a small victory for receiving the course of treatment which was able to be figured out by the great doctors at MOSL.
