#### Reflecting on the Past

During the second week after Robert’s fourth treatment, he took some time to think about his past and see if he could answer some questions such as the why or how. Robert knows he will probably never know the true answer to those questions, but he still looks back to see if he missed anything or did something that could have shifted his path to such a difficult and trying time.

#### Coping with the Present

This week Robert has been feeling decent and his rib pain is finally starting to subside, so he is not in constant pain. Robert still has frequent nausea and is still tired and fatigued more than usual but his solutions with dealing with those things help him get through each day better than the previous day. Robert’s mind and thoughts are also still jumbled but focusing on the future is a way Robert keeps from falling into his deep dark unwanted thoughts.

#### Shaping the future

Robert cannot change the past or change the present situation he finds himself in, but he can shape and mold his future to get back on the path he was setting prior to being diagnosed with cancer. Robert knows his life book can still be a good one that will just contain a bad chapter but that bad chapter can be used as a learning experience to help Robert with future trials and tribulations.

#### Early life in Charleston

Robert thought of his past and went through each part of his life to see if he could discover anything, and if not, that is fine as well, at least he would do what he could to try and settle his ever-wondering mind.

Robert started reminiscing about his past, starting from the very beginning. Robert was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina. He grew up in a loving family that was always supportive and helpful.

Robert went through elementary school and middle school in the Charleston area where he did good or at least average he thought. During the early years he had a great group of friends who he grew up with and he is still good friends with them to this day.

While in middle school Robert moved from Charleston to Aiken, South Carolina. That is where he would finish his schooling from Aiken High School. Robert worked as a cook at a family restaurant and at Pizza Hut while he was in school. Robert had a vehicle, so he had to put gas in it and eventually pay for his own insurance after the first few speeding tickets.

#### Transition to Aiken and High School

Robert didn’t like the whole idea of paying bills, but his parent’s wanted him to know it is part of life and it will always be, so he had to be responsible with his money if he wanted to keep driving. Robert was in a car accident in 1998 that put him in the hospital for a week with a collapsed lung, some fractured ribs, and a bruised kidney. Before that happened Robert had never really been injured or broke any bones. Robert was usually healthy and did not get sick that much, probably because his parents always made him eat well, which allowed his growing body to get the nutrients it needed.

Robert thinks about all the times he would get upset growing up because of the stuff he had to do, but as he looks back, he sees each thing was a piece to a bigger puzzle. Robert couldn’t think of anything from his childhood that could have caused this, so he continued to think of the next chapter of his life that might shine insight on the why or how.

#### Navy Journey and Its Impact

Robert went into the Navy in 2001 for two main reasons, he wasn’t ready to go through more schooling at the time and his dad retired from the Navy, so it seemed to be the best idea. Robert went to bootcamp in Great Lakes, Illinois. Once he completed basic training he went to Dam neck, Virginia for his A school to get training on his rating which was an operation specialist.

Robert was there for 10 weeks and after he graduated, he received sea duty orders which had him assigned to the USS Doyle (FFG-39). Robert had to fly to Panama to meet the ship since it was currently on deployment. Robert was onboarded and started his career as an operation specialist. In the beginning Robert had to work in the mess hall and laundry for the first four months, it was horrible and definitely not what he signed up for. It was called cranking and everyone new to the service had to go through it, so it was just one of those things that had to be done.

Robert spent four years in the Navy going on three deployments, visiting 52 countries, and achieving some maritime goals like getting order of the rock, order of the ditch, and his shellback authority. Robert looks back now and wishes he would have stayed in for a full career because he would be retired now and starting over instead of just starting over.

Robert knows the choices he made were with the information he knew and had at the time, and he did not want to be deploying every 16 months and out every weekend doing sea trials. Robert does not regret decisions and choices he made rather they were right or wrong, he would regret having an opportunity to do something and not doing it, so he always says don’t regret what you’ve done, regret what you could’ve done.

At the time Robert did not think of what certain things could have been doing to his body but now looking back he realizes some of the Navy stuff could have played a role in his situation. During his Navy time Robert suffered from migraines, occasional colds, and had surgery for ingrown toenails which was actually performed by an electronic technician and not a corpsman. Like his childhood Robert still did not get sick often and was still in good health. Robert does not know how long cancer cells take to mutate or how long they can just sit before causing issues so his time in the Navy could provide some of the how but not the why.

#### Return to Aiken and Entry into Public Safety

Robert returned to Aiken after he was honorably discharged from the Navy. Robert did not have a plan but knew he needed a job so he asked a friend who worked for Anheuser Busch if they were hiring, he said they were, and he could definitely get him a job. Robert worked there for a while before going to Beverage South to be a salesman. These were just jobs that provided Robert with a paycheck, he knew it was not a career.

In 2007 after two years of pointless jobs Robert had an opportunity to interview with the City of Aiken for a public safety officer position. Robert got hired and started a meaningful job where he was able to help people and feel like he was making a difference no matter how small it seemed. Robert went to the South Carolina Fire Academy where he graduated with his IFSAC firefighter II certification and then he attended the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy where he graduated earning his Law Enforcement I certification.

After getting both certifications Robert started his career, which he really enjoyed. In 2012 Robert decided he wanted to go work for the City of North Augusta since he had a few friends that left Aiken to go to North Augusta. Robert also wanted to go to school to get a degree in something to help his chances of promotion opportunities.

#### Pursuing a Bachelor's Degree

In 2013 Robert started college to obtain his bachelor’s degree in criminal justice with a minor in forensic psychology. Robert was busy during this time since he was working full-time and going to school, but he knew the hard work would be rewarded or at least that is what he thought at that time. Robert did that for three years until you graduated, receiving the bachelor’s degree he wanted. The degree was not a magic button and did not surface any opportunities Robert was looking for so in 2017 Robert left law enforcement to go to Kentucky to work for Ingram.

#### Sullivan's Island and Pursuing Rank

Robert missed making a difference and seemed like he had a purpose every day when he went to work so he did not work for Ingram long before returning to South Carolina to get back into a police career. Robert moved to the Charleston area instead of returning to Aiken because he always said he wanted to go back eventually after having to move in his childhood. Robert got on with Sullivan’s Island police department.

The job was great, Robert thought, but he wanted to do police work and use the skills and knowledge he worked so hard for. Sullivan’s Island is not a place where a lot of criminal activity or problems in general arise, so Robert talked with a few friends that worked at different departments around the area. Robert ultimately decided on going to the City of Hanahan. Robert worked his way through the ranks and was finally seeing his degree pay off since he was able to take the rank of sergeant.

#### A Desire to Make a Difference

Robert had ideas on how to help the community and different programs that the city could incorporate to help different members of the city. Robert pitched the ideas to command staff on a regular basis, but nothing ever came of any of them, so Robert tried to get his patrol shift to do things on a smaller scale.Robert and his shift did great work throughout the community, but nothing ever gained traction and it seemed like Robert was fighting against the department to help the community they were supposed to serve.

#### Exploring a Career Change

Robert thought he should have stayed out of law enforcement the first time, but he wanted to do something that would still give him purpose, make a difference, and come with high stress. Robert knew if he wanted to do anything other than police work, he would have to go back to school because policing is all he knew and had done for 15 years. Robert thought what other career field could give those things he was searching for. Robert’s mother had been in the medical field as a nurse, so he knew they would help people and make a difference. He wasn’t sure about the stress, but he did not want to be a nurse because after 15 years you want to be selective about the people you deal with if you have a choice.

Robert decided in 2021 to go back to school a second time to get an associate degree in surgical technology to get his foot in the door with the medical field.

#### Facing a Life-Altering Diagnosis

This is the stage in Robert’s life where he had to pause everything to deal with the lymphoma he was diagnosed with.

#### Pursuing Unfinished Goals

Robert wants to finish his degree and has started talking with the dean and his doctors to get back on track to finish the program. Robert finished 80 percent of the program before receiving the news about having cancer and having to go through chemotherapy, so he knows he is so close.

#### Overcoming Challenges

Robert only has clinicals left to graduate but that is the difficult part since he still has treatments and is not at 100 percent. Robert knows he will finish at some point, but he is not sure exactly when.

#### Reflecting on the Past

The past had Robert thinking if he did something different at any point would it have changed anything. Robert ran through his life quickly to see if anything stood out, but nothing ever does besides the how with his naval career. Is it even possible to know the how since the doctors cannot even provide that information. Robert thinks of those two things often but then he thinks does it matter or would having those answers really change anything.

#### A Life of Purpose and Service

Roberts had a good life and has done a lot of good for a lot of people, which he wants to continue to do if he is given the chance.

#### Embracing the Unknown

This chapter will add to Robert’s knowledge and ability to help people and know he can relate in a deeper way than just saying he understands. Robert will just stay positive and keep focusing on the future so he can get to the next chapter in his life and look back at this one as he did all the others.
