#### Navigating the Rollercoaster

Each week has its ups and downs but Robert has recently hit a wall which has had nothing but downs.

**Health Concerns**

For the second and third weeks after treatment Robert hasn’t felt good and has been having abdominal pain. He is hoping the pain is from his ribs and not his spleen becoming enlarged again.

**Mental Struggles & Unwanted Reflections**

Robert has also had a hard time with his thoughts and mind these past two weeks after he thought it was getting better. The last post about looking at the past to see what could have caused this situation definitely didn’t do Robert any favors just got him thinking and processing unnecessary information. Robert doesn’t want to think of any of it but it is uncomfortable until he realizes what he is actually doing.

#### The Unseen Damage

The bad thing about not knowing is the damage that is done while he doesn’t realize it and then it’s apologies to his loved ones once he gets it brought to his attention. Robert hates it because nobody really understands it so it seems to be a constant excuse for him being a bad human.

**Resuming Clinical Rotation**

Robert has started his clinical rotation to finish school after a four month break. It has been difficult for Robert in all aspects from physical to mental.

**Physical and Mental Struggles**

Robert doesn’t have his normal endurance so working for 9 hours is hard especially being on his feet and having to use parts of his body he hasn’t had to in months. The mental part is just as bad because Robert was always on the Dean’s List and didn’t have a problem with retaining information. Robert definitely has a problem retaining and learning new information at the moment.

**Overcoming Challenges**

Robert did not want to wait any longer to return because that would have just held his life up that much longer. Robert now wonders if he tried too much too soon. Robert also thinks the overload is what has made the past two weeks so bad.

**Seeking a New Routine**

Robert was hoping to fall into a new routine of actually doing something and getting back to helping people and getting the feeling of making a difference. Thus far Robert has not had the feelings he was looking for but he hopes as he can get his body and mind on track it will get better.

**Medication Woes**

Robert also ran completely out of his prescribed medication the past two days so nothing is going right.

#### Yearning for Normalcy

Robert wishes daily he could just be who he was and get on with his life. This horrible holding pattern is not good for Robert or people around him. Not having the ability to be himself is a constant struggle that has ruined so much and continues to destroy certain things.

**Reevaluation of Priorities**

Robert knows he will return to normal but with what. Robert didn’t have much before this situation besides loving parents and a wonderful girlfriend. Robert’s appreciation for family and loved ones has taken the top spot so he will be happy if he is able to return to himself with that since that is most important. As far as material things go which isn’t important but is helpful Robert knows he doesn’t have anything but his clothes in a few bags.

#### The Desire to Reclaim Normality

Once this entire situation comes to an end Robert wants to go back to being who he was and to have somewhere he is completely comfortable and can start the next chapter of his life. Robert understands the key to that is trying not to let his uncontrollable and forgetful mind burn down everything.

**Struggles with Chemo Brain**

Robert doesn’t want people to let him get away with how he is but to understand its not so easy to control or manage because of the medication and chemotherapy. In the beginning Robert was told about chemo brain and didn’t really get it but it seems the more treatments the more he understands because he is having all the symptoms with no positive outlook.

**Isolation and Self-Management**

Robert keeps this up he will have to start managing everything himself with no outlet or nobody to try to get it and understand. Robert is difficult to be around at times which he knows and if he could he would get away from himself if it was possible.

#### Questioning the Path Chosen

Sometimes Robert thinks what could have happened if he never decided to do chemotherapy. Robert knows the answer to that but it is his twist to wishing he never got sick. Someone as mentally strong as Robert having such a difficult time with everything is hard to swallow.

**Reluctance to Seek Help**

Robert wonders if his reluctance to asking or allowing help makes it harder when he could just let it go and be sick to get better and back to normal. Robert can write stuff so easy but that is so difficult for him to actually do. While being foggy and unclear that has done more harm than good in every way.

**The Struggle to Adapt**

The more Robert tries the worse it gets, he might have to get used to being the way he is at this very moment. Robert doesn’t want that but Robert knows he caused it sick or not. Robert has to get stable and get stuff together so he can always have somewhere to go when he has nowhere.

**Anticipation and Dread of Treatment**

Robert is looking forward to and dreading his fifth treatment next week. It’s one more closer for Robert to return to his old self. That self wasn’t the best but it was a thousand times better than chemo Robert. Robert was thinking of changing his name to Dave until he is done, Dave just seems like a name that would act like a chemo brain.
