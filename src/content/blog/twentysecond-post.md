**Appointment and Arrival**

On Wednesday, November 1, 2023, Robert went to Charleston for his scheduled PET scan. Robert arrived at the hospital at 1300 hours for his 1330 appointment.

**Check-in and Paperwork**

Robert checked in at the front desk and proceeded to the radiology department to be called back to have his scan done to see how the treatments had been going. Robert completed the required paperwork which was given to him at the front desk, and he was advised to give the radiology tech when he is called back.

**Pre-Scan Process**

Robert sat in the empty lobby for about 15 minutes before someone came to get him and walked him to the back to start the process. Robert sat in the chair situated in the middle of the exam room while the tech took his vitals and blood before giving him the radioactive material that is required prior to having the PET scan done.

**Explanation of the Scan Process**

The tech made sure Robert’s levels were good and once they were checked and came back normal the tech explained the process. The tech said she was going to hook him up to the machine which would put the radioactive material in him through an IV, and he had to sit for an hour before having the scan done. Robert stated he understood everything and signed a consent form to allow the scan to be taken.

**Machine Operation and Waiting**

The tech hooked up the machine and started it, and then she stepped out of the room for approximately 10 minutes while the machine ran. Robert sat in the exam room waiting patiently for the hour to pass so he could have the PET scan done.

Robert didn’t have much to do and there was no TV in the room, so he just sat thinking about the past few weeks since his fourth treatment.

**Reflection on Chemotherapy and Resuming Life**

Robert was glad to be getting closer and closer to being finished with his chemotherapy treatments because it was continuing to take a toll on all aspects of his life, and he was ready to be done with it so he could get on with life.

**Return to School and Sense of Purpose**

Robert started going back to school on Monday, October 23, 2023. This gave him a sense of purpose and a feeling that his life was starting to move forward once again instead of being in a holding pattern.

Robert is done with his classroom classes and only has four months of clinicals left so with him being able to go it made him glad because he was chipping away at the time that he needed to complete to graduate. Going back was good but it definitely wasn’t easy for Robert.

**Challenges and Adjustments to Routine**

Each day Robert had to get back to a routine of working and learning which was difficult since he had spent five months doing none of that. Robert thought each day he needed to remember the stuff he learned in class over the past two years to apply it while he was at the hospital, but it was not coming back so easy at first.

**Struggles at Home and Positive Mindset**

The first few days were rough but eventually Robert’s brain started ticking and he was able to remember some things, he couldn’t remember everything but the fact of some of it coming back was good. Robert also had a struggling two weeks at home trying to manage going back to work and having to learn while still staying in a positive mindset while having so much going on.

**Coping with Change and Self-Reflection**

Robert still isn’t himself and he continues to try his hardest to be the best person he can while not letting everything going on affect him. Robert sat in the chair thinking of all this while waiting on that hour to pass. This single hour felt like an eternity to him because it seemed as if time had stopped.

**Reflection and Moving Forward**

Robert thought of what he could have done better or not done at all, but all those thoughts didn’t matter because he cannot go back in time to change anything. Robert just had to learn from his mistakes and move forward and hope for the best possible outcome.

**Managing Thoughts and Focus on School**

The outcome was still an unknown because Robert does not have complete control of himself yet but the more he concentrates and focuses he is able to push out the thoughts and keep his mind busy with school which seemed to help a little, but it still wasn’t perfect.

As Robert kept replaying the past couple weeks and everything that happened the tech walked in and told him the hour was up and she was going to walk him back to have the scan done.

**Preparation for PET Scan**

Robert walked into the PET scan room, and the tech asked him to take off his watch and necklace. Robert did as instructed and set both of them on the chair in the corner of the room. Robert was asked to lie on the table and put both arms above his head.

**Scan Procedure and Duration**

The tech explained the scan and told him it would take about 15 minutes. Robert said no problem. Robert closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep so he could stop thinking for a few minutes, but it didn’t work.

**Positive Thinking and Tonia's Influence**

Robert was trying to think of the best possible outcome of the scan and did not want to think of anything negative because he could hear Tonia telling him not to put that negativity in the atmosphere, so he just thought positive and hoped for the best.

**Confidence in Actions and Advice**

Robert knew he did all he could and what he was supposed to. Tonia also always made sure that Robert kept up with all the advice he was given by his oncologists so there was nothing that could be done at this point to change the results.

Robert closed his eyes and thought about the future he wanted after receiving good news tomorrow from the results of this scan.

**Scan Process and Completion**

The machine started, and the table started to move through the scanner. This went on for 15 minutes just like the tech said and when it was completed, she walked back into the room and told Robert he was done.

Robert got up and started to put his watch and necklace back on while asking the tech if she had seen the scan as it was being done. The tech stated it would take a few minutes to upload and then it would be sent to the radiologist to read, and then the results would be sent to his oncologist.

**Leaving the Hospital**

Robert said okay and thanked her as he walked out of the room. Robert left the hospital and walked to his car to drive to Bonneau.

Robert was staying in Bonneau for the night because he had his fifth treatment scheduled for 0730 hours tomorrow, November 2, 2023. Tonia was driving down this evening once she got off work to be with him tomorrow during his treatment.

**Evening Stroll and Anticipation of Tonia's Arrival**

Robert returned to the house and decided to go for a walk to wait for Tonia to arrive. Robert was excited to see Tonia because of the previous week, and he missed her.

**Enjoyable Walk and Reflection**

Robert walked around the neighborhood enjoying the weather and the fact that he was feeling good since this good feeling would be gone tomorrow after the treatment. Robert walked for two hours and then went back to the house to watch TV and relax.

**Evening Entertainment and Relaxation**

Robert watched TV until Tonia arrived. When Tonia got there, they ate together since she picked up food on her way and they watched some episodes of Big Brother to get caught up on the few episodes they missed last week.

**Treatment Appointment Preparation**

Robert told Tonia he had his alarm set for 0545 hours and they needed to leave by 0615 hours to make the 0730-hour appointment. Tonia said okay and was glad Robert set the time to give her 30 minutes to get ready in the morning.

Robert and Tonia went to bed around 2300 hours to be able to get up and get going to be on time.

**Morning Routine and Timely Departure**

The next morning Robert and Tonia got up at 0545 hours as planned and left the house by 0615 hours also as planned, so they were right on schedule. Robert drove to the hospital downtown through the ridiculous traffic as always and they arrived right on time with no time to spare.

**Arrival at the Hospital**

Robert parked in the parking garage. Robert and Tonia walked to Hollings Cancer Center, and Robert thanked Tonia for coming, and she said of course. No matter how bad Robert messes up or makes her mad she is always there for him.

Robert and Tonia walked into the building and went to the second floor to get checked in and get the day started. Robert checked in at the front desk and then walked to the back to check in at the infusion center. Robert followed the same process he had done four previous times.

Robert was called and he went to get his port accessed and get his blood drawn then walked back to the front lobby to wait to have his vitals taken and see the doctor.

**Consultation with the Doctor**

Robert was called to have his vitals taken and then told to have a seat and they would come get him when the doctor was ready to see him. Robert and Tonia waited and eventually they walked back to an exam room to be seen by the doctor.

The doctor came in and asked them how they were doing, Robert and Tonia both said good. The doctor said she did not have the official results from the radiologist from the PET scan yesterday, but she said she did not need a radiologist to know that the scan was good.

**Positive News from the Doctor**

The doctor handed Robert a piece of paper of the scan which had two scans on it, it was a before and after. Robert glanced at it not really knowing what it was and handed it to Tonia as the doctor started to explain what they were looking at.

The doctor said the scan on the left was from July and the scan on the right was from yesterday. The scan on the left had tons of black all over Robert’s body which the doctor said was enlarged lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen. The scan on the right had very little black on it, and the doctor said the black that is on the right is supposed to be there because they were organs picked up by the scan.

**Emotional Reaction and Gratitude**

This was excellent news and Robert could see that the chemotherapy had been working and all this craziness was not for nothing. Robert really didn’t know what to say or think because like the initial news he was lost for words and could not process quickly enough to really have a thought about it.

**Hope for the Future**

Robert was just happy because he could see an end in sight, and he would get his body back, and now if he could get his head back, he would be good to go.

**Official Report and Remission Status**

While talking with the doctor, the official report came back from radiology, which said most of what the doctor said, but Robert’s spleen was still a bit larger than they wanted to see so he was not officially in remission _yet_, but his score was a 4. The doctor told him 1 to 3 usually means remission.

**Reassurance and Future Outlook**

The doctor told Robert not to worry because he has today's treatment and one more so she was sure by that time he would fall under a 4 and be classified as in remission for his lymphoma. Robert was so happy and overjoyed by the news but he didn’t know how to express it so he stayed neutral as he talked with the doctor.

**Addressing Cognitive Issues**

Robert asked the doctor about his mind and memory issues he has been having from the chemotherapy. The doctor told Robert those feelings were completely normal, and she would prescribe him some medicine to try and help with it until he is done with his treatments.

**Future Treatment Plans**

The doctor talked about the upkeep of the lymphoma for a bit but said they would talk more about it later once a plan is set in place to maintain the remission once it is obtained. Robert and Tonia thanked the doctor as she told Robert he was cleared to receive his treatment.

Robert and Tonia walked back to the infusion center to check in and tell them he was clear for treatment. Robert waited a brief time before being called and escorted to his infusion chair.

**Supportive Atmosphere during Treatment**

Robert sat in the chair and took his medication as the nurse started the treatment process. The process went the same as each other time. Robert and Tonia played qwiddler while he was receiving the treatment which was great because it kept Robert’s mind busy and helped time pass.

**Completion of Fifth Treatment**

After four hours Robert was done with his fifth treatment and just had one more to go. Just one more Robert thought, and he would be done with this dreadful chapter of his life.

**Reflection on the Past Six Months**

Robert thought this had been a horrible six months, but maybe some good came from it. Robert learned a lot about himself and what truly matters in life so although this has been a bad time maybe it was done to him for a reason.

**Finding Meaning in Difficult Times**

The true reason is yet to be known but as long as Robert stays positive and looks for the possible positive reasons one might shine through, and it will all be understood. Until that point Robert has a lot to be thankful for and be appreciative of so he will not dwell on the negative but focus on the positive as he is starting to get his life back one day at a time.

Robert and Tonia drove back to Bonneau.
