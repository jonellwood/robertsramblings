			<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Reader!</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to my site. This is a place where I can post about my lymphoma journey. Please feel free to read through and if anything is helpful or relevant to your journey - then all the better.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am writing these posts in "real-time" and they reflect my thoughts and feelings at the time. 
			</p>
			<p>What you might find while reading through my page:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Details about what is going on in my life that might make you feel uncomfortable.</li>
				<li>Information on how you can learn more about Lymphoma</li>
				<li>Inspiration on getting more involved and helping others on a similar journey as me.</li>
				<li>Probably some other stuff too that I have not thought of yet</li>
